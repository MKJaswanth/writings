## 💡 **About This Project**  
This is my attempt at building something cool while avoiding my other responsibilities.  
It's coded with love, sweat, and a friendly conversation with chatGPT.  

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (aka Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V from w3schools)  
- **Backend:** Node.js (because everyone else is doing it)  
- **Database:** SQLite (because it’s lightweight, just like my patience)  

## 🐛 **Bugs**  
- There are no bugs. Only unexpected features.  
- If you find one, congrats! You’re now a contributor.  

## 📦 **Installation**  
1. Clone this repository (because you’ll regret it otherwise).  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MKJaswanth/writings.git

2.npm start
3.Pray
